The names of all exercise files should start with a capitical letter.

This is a temporary solution to an issue with how Jekyll processes pages.

Jekyll currently processes pages in alphabetical order. This results
in cases where, when the name of an exercise included in an assignment
comes after the name of the assignment alphabetically, the
assignment page is processed before the exercise and the list in the
exercise is not properly converted to a list.

By naming all of the exercises to start with captical letters, and
therefore come before the names of the assignments (which are all lower
case) alphabetically.
