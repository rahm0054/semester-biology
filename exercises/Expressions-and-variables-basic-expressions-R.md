Write the following calculations in the text editor.

1. 2 - 10
2. 3 \* 5
3. 9 / 2
4. 5 - 3 \* 2
5. (5 - 3) \* 2
6. 4 ^ 2
7. 8 / 2 ^ 2

Run them by either clicking the `Run` button in the top-right corner of the editor or press Ctrl+Enter
(Windows & Linux) or Command+Enter (Mac) to run code and print the results in the console.

If no code is highlighted/selected this will run the line the cursor is on.
If you highlighted/selected a block of code it will run that entire group of lines.

You can also run the entire script by clicking the arrow next to `Source` and selecting `Source with Echo` or by using Ctrl+Shift+Enter
(Windows & Linux) or Command+Shift+Enter (Mac).

To tell someone reading the code what this section of the code is about,
add a comment line that says 'Exercise 1' before the code that answers
the exercise. Comments in R are added by adding the `#` sign.
Anything after a `#` sign on the same line is ignored when the program is
run. So, the start of your program should look something like:

```r
# Exercise 1

#1.1
2 - 10

#1.2
3 * 5
```
