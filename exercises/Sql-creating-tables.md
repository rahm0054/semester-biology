title: SQL - Creating Tables
---

Start a new Python file that you will use to answer the rest of the
questions for this assignment.

Using Python create a new table in the Portal database called FieldNotes
and should include information on the date of sampling that the notes
apply to (designed in such a way as to allow it to be linked to the main
table) and a large text field for entering notes.

*I would definitely recommend using VARCHAR for the notes field because
you have no idea how extensive future notes might be and the notes will
probably vary wildly in length*.
