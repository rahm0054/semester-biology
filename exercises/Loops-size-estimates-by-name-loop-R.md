This is a followup to [Size Estimates by Name]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Making-choices-size-estimates-by-name-R).

Download and import [data on dinosaur lengths with species names]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/dinosaur_lengths.csv).

Write a function `mass_from_length()` that uses the equation `mass <- a * length^b` to estimate the size of a dinosaur from its length.
This function should take two arguments, `length` and `species`. For each of the following inputs for `species`, use the given values of `a` and `b` for the calculation:

* For `Stegosauria`:  `a = 10.95` and `b = 2.64` ([Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171)).
* For `Theropoda`:  `a = 0.73` and `b = 3.63` ([Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171)).
* For `Sauropoda`:  `a` = `214.44` and `b = 1.46` ([Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171)).
* For any other value of `species`: `a = 25.37` and `b = 2.49`.

1. Use this function and a for loop to calculate the estimated mass for each dinosaur, store the masses in a vector, and after all of the calculations are complete show the first few items in the vector using `head()`.
2. Add the results in the vector back to the original data frame. Show the first few rows of the data frame using `head()`.
3. Calculate the mean mass for each `species` using `dplyr`.
