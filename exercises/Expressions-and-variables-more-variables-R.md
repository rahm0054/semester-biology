Calculate a total biomass in grams for 3 white-throated woodrats
([*Neotoma albigula*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-throated_woodrat)) and
then convert it to kilograms. The total biomass is three times the average size
of a single individual. An average individual weighs 250 grams.

* Add a new section to your R script starting with a comment.
* Create a variable `grams` and assign it the mass of a single
*Neotoma albigula* (250).
* Create a variable `number` and assign it the number of individuals (3).
* Create a variable `biomass` and assign it a value by multiplying
the `grams` and `number` variables together.
* Convert the value of `biomass` into kilograms (there are 1000
grams in a kilogram so divide by 1000) and assign this value to a new
variable.
* Print the final answer to the screen.
