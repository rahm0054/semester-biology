title: SQL - Updating Records
---

Add the following note to the FieldNotes table in the Portal database
for the date 10/1/2013:

"Vegetation seems to have returned to normal for this time of year. The
landscape isn't exactly green, but there is a decent amount of plant
activity and there should be enough food for the rodents to the winter"

Commit this change to the database. As soon as you've commited it you
realized that this was the update for October 2012, not October 2013
(obviously; I mean it's not like we have a time machine...). Update the
record so that it contains the appropriate value.
