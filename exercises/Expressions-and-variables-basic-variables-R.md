Here is a small program that converts a mass in kilograms to a mass in grams and
then prints out the resulting value.

```
mass_kg <- 2.62
mass_g <- mass_kg * 1000
mass_g
```
Create similar code to convert a mass in pounds to a mass kilograms.
* Create a variable to store a body mass in pounds. Assign this variable a value of 3.5 (an appropriate mass for a [Sylvilagus audubonii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_cottontail)).
* Convert the variable from body mass in pounds to body mass in kilograms (by dividing it by 2.2046), and assign it to a new variable.
* Print the value of the new variable to the screen.
